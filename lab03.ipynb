    "for certain classes of problems, and some are open source while others\n",

    "> **JuMP Syntax**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The core pieces of setting up a `JuMP` model involve specifying the\n",
    "> model and adding variables, the objective, and constraints. At the\n",
    "> most simple level, this syntax looks like this:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` julia\n",
    "> m = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)\n",
    "> @variable(m, lb <= x <= ub) # if you do not have upper or lower bounds, you can drop those accordingly\n",
    "> @variable(m, lb <= y <= ub)\n",
    "> @objective(m, Max, 100x + 250y) # replace Max with Min depending on the problem\n",
    "> @constraint(m, label, 6x + 12y <= 80) # replace \"label\" with some meaningful string you would like to use later to query shadow prices, or drop it\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You can add more constraints or more variables as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Using Array Syntax**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You can set up multiple variables or constraints at once using array\n",
    "> syntax. For example, the following are equivalent:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` julia\n",
    "> @variable(m, G1 >= 0)\n",
    "> @variable(m, G2 >= 0)\n",
    "> @variable(m, G3 >= 0)\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> and\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` julia\n",
    "> @variable(m, G[1:3] >= 0)\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You can also set up multiple constraints using arrays of coefficients\n",
    "> and/or bounds. For example:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` julia\n",
    "> I = 1:3\n",
    "> d = [0; 3; 5]\n",
    "> @constraint(m, demand[i in I], G[i] >= d[i])\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "`JuMP` is finicky about changing objects and constraints, so I recommend\n",
    "setting up all of the model syntax in one notebook cell, which is what\n",
    "we will do here."

The objective function should represent the total profit from the different grades of plywood, so it should consider not only the revenue per 1000 bf of plywood, but also the costs of sourcing the amount of spruce and fir needed. I decided th turn everything into units of 1 bf, instead of 1000, to make things a little clearer.
